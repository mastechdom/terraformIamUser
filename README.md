This repository contains the necessary files and instructions for deploying an EC2 machine using Terraform Script.

## Prerequisite:

- Install terraform [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn6xYf0QJME&t=8s)
- Setup your AWS account [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhW17g73fvY&t=357s)

## Steps to run this code

Step-by-step user guide [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fRf1p3izDl-JJuWF7npu99SSbUkXNFl2/view?usp=drive_link).

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/madgicaltechdom/nowigence.git
```

2. Navigate to the nowigence directory.

```
cd nowigence
```

3. Firstly you have to provide your access key value in the variable.tf file.
    
```
variable "access_key" {
  description = "value"
  default     = ""
}
```

4. Secondly, you have to provide your secret key value in the variable.tf file.

```
variable "secret_key" {
  description = "value"
  default     = ""
}
```

5. Make changes in the rest of the variables according to your need in the variable.tf file.

6. Also, have a look at the main.tf file and make changes in the "aws_security_group" resource according to your need.

7. Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform project.

8. Run `terraform plan` to see the changes that Terraform will make.

9. Run `terraform apply` to create the Ubuntu machine.

10. Connect to the VMs using the SSH key.

```
ssh -i <private key path> user_name@public_ip
```

## Clean up

To delete the machine that Terraform created, run `terraform destroy`.

# How to install and set up the Nifi

By following the below steps you can able to install and set up the Nifi.

## Prerequisite:

- Ubuntu machine with root access, 22 and 8080 ports.
- You should have sudo or root access to run privileged commands.
- You should have OpenJDK 11 installed on your Server.
- You should have apt or apt-get, wget, and unzip utility installed in your Server.

1. SSH to the Ubuntu machine by running the below command and switch to the root user:

```
ssh -i <private key path> user_name@public_ip
```

2. Update your server by running the below command:
   
```
apt update
```

3. Download Apache [Nifi 1.23.0](https://archive.apache.org/dist/nifi/) using wget by running the below command:

```
wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/nifi/1.23.0/nifi-1.23.0-bin.zip
```

4. Unzip the folder using unzip utility by running the below command:

```
unzip nifi-1.23.0-bin.zip
```

5. Set the JAVA_HOME path by running the below command:

```
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/
```
If you don't have the JAVA_HOME environment variable set, then you need to set it with the OpenJDK path. In my setup, it is on /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/.

6. Verify the path by running the below command:

```
echo $JAVA_HOME
```

7. Navigate to the nifi-1.23.0/conf/, open the nifi.properties file, search for the "web properties", and make changes in the port and host by running the below command(I am using Vim editor).

```
cd nifi-1.23.0/conf/
vi nifi.properties
```

8. Set the Nifi single-user credentials by running the below command:

```
./nifi.sh set-single-user-credentials <username> <password>
```
  
9. Navigate to the nifi-1.23.0/bin/ and start Apache Nifi by running the below command:

```
cd nifi-1.23.0/bin/
./nifi.sh start
```

10. Check the status of Nifi by running the below command:

```
./nifi.sh status
```

11. Now, browse this URL: https://<YOUR_MACHINE_IP>:8080/nifi you can see the Nifi login page, then provide the user credentials that you created in the 8th step for login.
